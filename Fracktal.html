    <h2 class="main-body-text">Exploring self-similarity</h2>
    
    <p class="main-body-text">Fractal, in mathematics: any of a class of complex geometric shapes that commonly have “fractional dimension,”
        a concept first introduced by the mathematician Felix Hausdorff in 1918. Fractals are distinct from the simple
        figures of classical, or Euclidean, geometry—the square, the circle, the sphere, and so forth. They are capable
        of describing many irregularly shaped objects or spatially nonuniform phenomena in nature such as coastlines and
        mountain ranges. The term fractal, derived from the Latin word fractus (“fragmented,” or “broken”), was coined
        by the Polish-born mathematician Benoit B. Mandelbrot. (The background of this site is a Mandlebrot set.)</p>
    <p class="main-body-text">
        Fractals are complex patterns that are self-similar, and therefore exhibit similar patterns at every scale.
        Fractals can be patterns or shapes that are non-regular and differ from traditional geometric shapes, but
        occur very commonly in nature, such as clouds, mountains, trees and snowflakes.</p>

    <h2 class="main-body-text">Types of Fractals</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Exact self-similarity</b> — This is the strongest type of self-similarity; the fractal appears identical at 
            different scales. Fractals defined by iterated function systems often display exact self-similarity.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Quasi-self-similarity</b> - This is a loose form of self-similarity; the fractal appears approximately (but not exactly) identical at different scales. 
            Quasi-self-similar fractals contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms.
            Fractals defined by recurrence relations are usually quasi-self-similar but not exactly self-similar.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Statistical self-similarity</b> - This is the weakest type of self-similarity; the fractal has numerical or statistical measures which are 
            preserved across scales. Most reasonable definitions of "fractal" trivially imply some form of statistical self-similarity.
            (Fractal dimension itself is a numerical measure which is preserved across scales.) Random fractals are examples of fractals which are statistically self-similar, 
            but neither exactly nor quasi-self-similar.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="main-body-text">Generating Fractals</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Escape-time fractals:</b> — These are defined by a recurrence relation at each point in a space (such as the complex plane).</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Iterated function systems</b> - These have a fixed geometric replacement rule.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Random fractals</b> - Generated by stochastic rather than deterministic processes.</li>
      </ol>
