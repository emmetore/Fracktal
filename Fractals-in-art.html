    <h1>Fracktal</h1>
    <h2>Fractals in Art</h2>
    <p>Artists have been embedding fractal patterns in their works through the centuries and across many cultures.
        Fractals can be found, for example, in Roman, Egyptian, Aztec, Incan and Mayan works. Examples
        of fractal art from more recent times include da Vinci's Turbulence (1500), Hokusai's Great Wave (1830),
        M.C. Escher's Circle Series (1950s) and, of course, Pollock's poured paintingsâ€”fractal patterns have been found in the paintings of American artist Jackson Pollock. While Pollock's paintings 
        appear to be composed of chaotic dripping and splattering, computer analysis has found fractal patterns in his work.</p>
